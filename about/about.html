            <h1>Who am I?</h1>
            <p>Hello! I'm Kris, an undergraduate student in Engineering, civil, and Business, Accounting based in the vibrant city of Sydney. My professional journey has led me to work in client-side project management within the construction industry.</p>
            <p>Outside of my academic and professional life, I have a deep love for adventure and the great outdoors. I've had the incredible opportunity to work as a snowboarding instructor for two winter seasons in Japan, a place that holds a special place in my heart. When I'm not on the slopes, you can find me surfing or taking long weekend trips away from the hustle and bustle of Sydney in my van, exploring new places and experiencing the beauty of nature.</p>
            <p>Photography and videography are among my creative pursuits. Through my lens, I aim to create compelling visuals that tell a story and build a strong, authentic image. Additionally, I have a passion for web development, which has led me to make this very website here.</p>
            <p>I'm always eager to learn new things and embrace new challenges, whether in my professional field or personal interests. Join me on my journey as I blend my technical expertise with my creative passions, continually seeking growth and new experiences.</p>
